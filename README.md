Resume
======
The source code for my resume, written in React.

The resume template is based off of [Adrien Friggeri's CV Resume template](https://github.com/adrianforsius/friggeri-cv) but ported over to use React instead of LaTeX.

You are welcome to clone and modify the source code to create a resume all your own.
